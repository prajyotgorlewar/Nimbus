# Nimbus

Nimbus is a modern communication app designed for seamless global connection via email-based login. Unlike phone-based messengers, Nimbus allows you to discover and connect with all users of the app, message them, view their current status or tagline, and initiate instant video or voice calls — all powered by Firebase Authentication, Realtime Database, ZegoCloud SDK, and Firebase Cloud Messaging.
